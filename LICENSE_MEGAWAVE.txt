MEGAWAVE PUBLIC LICENSE 

Terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and modification
of megawave versions 2.x and 3.x.

You acknowledge to be informed about the following facts, and you
accept the consequences :
- megawave is a "soft-publication" for the scientific community,
  intented to offer reproducible research in image processing;
- megawave is maintained by the image department of the CMLA, a public
  french laboratory associated to the CNRS UMR-8536, Ecole Normale
  Superieure de Cachan;
- the image department is founded by the CMLA only, using public funds
  and private grants for software development;
- megawave has been implemented for research purposes only; it comes
  therefore without any warranty.
- the megawave compiler and the system libraries are known to run on
  some computer models and operating systems only;
- the CMLA may not maintain this software in the future;
- the CMLA can not help any user to install nor to use the software;
- the CMLA may not publish all of the code contained in the various
  versions of megawave;
- for transparency, the published code contains the source of the
  mathematical algorithms developed at the CMLA. You are allowed to
  copy, modify and redistribute these programs.

The CMLA claims to impose on the diffusion and on the use of its
software the same rules than the well-known rules which apply to paper
publication.

You agree to :
- inform without delay the CMLA about any contract between yourself or
  your department and any private or public organization, in the case
  where its execution uses an algorithm (modified or not) included in
  megawave; you will inform this organization about the origin of
  these algorithm by writing in the contract the use of the megawave
  software.
- make mention in all products (as computer programs or scientific
  papers) which take advantage of an algorithm included in megawave
  (modified or not), of the use of this software together with the
  name(s) of the author(s) written in the header of the corresponding
  module and with the address of the CMLA and of other laboratories
  implied in the development, if any.
