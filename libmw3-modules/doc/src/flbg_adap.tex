This module enables to generate a set of codebooks adapted for classified 
vector quantization\index{quantization!vector} using the LBG algorithm 
(see {\em flbg\_train} documentation or \cite{gersho.gray:vector}, 
\cite{linde.buzo.ea:algorithm}). 
Here the classification of the vectors is made according to their energy 
(see {\em fvq} or {\em mk\_trainset} documentations). 

The training sets of vectors for the LBG algorithm are extracted from 
the floating point images read in {\em TrainImage1}, ..., {\em TrainImage8} 
files. There is one training set for each generated codebook. 
These codebooks are stored in the files {\em Output1}, ..., {\em Output4} 
files. Their respective sizes are {\em CBSize1}, ..., {\em CBSize4}. 

The -w and -h options have the same meaning as in {\em mk\_trainset} : 
they enable to tune the size and shape of vectors. 

The -l, -d and -e options have the same meaning as in {\em mk\_trainset} : 
they permit to control of the construction of training sets. 

The -S, -T and -U options have the same meaning respectively as the -t, -u 
and -v options in {\em mk\_trainset}.  

The -W, -M and -p options have the same effect as in {\em flbg\_train} 
module.
