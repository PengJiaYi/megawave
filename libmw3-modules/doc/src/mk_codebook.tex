{\em mk\_codebook} enables to generate random codebooks to be used as initial 
data for the LBG algorithm (see {\em flbg} module documentation). The 
coordinates of the vectors are considered as i.i.d. random variables. 
Their distribution is either normal (if the -n option is selected) 
or uniform. One can choose also their mean and variance with the help 
of the -m and -v options. The -s and -b options permit to control 
the size of codebook and the size of vectors in codebook. 

As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to consider the output 
of {\em mk\_codebook} as a codebook. It is merely a random matrix 
of i.i.d. floating point. It can thus be used for other purposes 
than creation of random codebooks.
