This module reconstructs an image from the compressed file {\em Compress}, 
which has been generated using the compression modules {\em ezw} 
or {\em fezw}. The reconstructed image is put in Qimage. 

First the wavelet transform of {\em Qimage} is reconstructed from 
the information contained in the {\em Compress} file. 
Then a scaling of the coefficients is made if he -w option is selected. 
Finally an inverse wavelet transform is applied to reconstruct the image
{\em Qimage}. 

All the options should be selected and tuned in exactly the same 
manner at the compresion ({\em fezw}) and decompression ({\em fiezw}). 
Likewise, {\em ImpulseResponse} should be the same 
at the compresion and decompression.
