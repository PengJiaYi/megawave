This module prints several informations concerning a set of curves (Dlists):
\begin{itemize}
\item the total number of Dlists
\item for each Dlist: the number of points, the 
perimeter and related measures (see \verb+perimeter+ module),
the area (see \verb+area+ module), and the number of convex
components in double (see \verb+dsplit_convex+ module) and in
float (see \verb+fsplit_convex+) precision.
\end{itemize}
