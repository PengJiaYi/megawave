Please read this note entirely before installing MegaWave2.


1) COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

  MegaWave2 is a "software publication" from a french laboratory of applied mathematics, 
the CMLA (CNRS UMR-8536). Please read the file COPYRIGHT to learn more on the different
contributions.

2) WHAT IS MEGAWAVE2

  MegaWave2 is a Unix software environment which help human being to write algorithms
on signal processing and image analysis. 
  The human being is actually assumed to be non-computer scientist, in 
particular he is likely to be a mathematician (notice however that a good 
knowledge of the C language is assumed).

  This means that the programmer should focus its mind on the algorithm only and
not on pure computer problems (such how to read an image, how to display a movie
on the screen, how to select a curve with the mouse, how to manage an object 
library). 

  The solution adopted by MegaWave2 is the concept of modules that is, of black
boxes where the algorithms are described as C functions, without any 
assumption about the context in which the modules may be executed.
This is the task of the MegaWave2 compiler (basically a MegaWave2 preprocessor
followed by a standard C compiler) to make from a module a run-time command, 
a function of a library or a function to be run under a window-oriented 
interpreter.

  Anyway, there exists other very good signal and image processing softwares.
Therefore, the main advantage you may see by using MegaWave2 is to have access to
some modules implementing new algorithms not available elsewhere. Indeed, if
MegaWave2 is first used as a research tool inside our team, its publication outside
our lab participates in reproducible research : you will find here most of the
source codes that have been used to perform the experiments presented in our
traditional paper publication.


3) HOW TO GET THE LAST VERSION OF MEGAWAVE2 2.x

  From the Web site http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/Cmla/Megawave
download the main package named MegaWave2_V2.<x>.tar.gz (if you have gunzip) or
MegaWave2_V2.<x>.tar.Z (if you don't), where <x> is a minor version number.

  Decompress the main package using the command:
		gunzip MegaWave2_V2.<x>.tar.gz
	  or 
		uncompress MegaWave2_V2.<x>.tar.Z  

  Then restore the main package MegaWave2 by typing
		tar xf MegaWave2_V2.<x>.tar

  in the current local directory where you want to put the software.


4) HOW TO INSTALL MEGAWAVE2
  
  The complete procedure to install MegaWave2 is described in the section 2 of 
the guide #1 "MegaWave2 User's Guide".
  So the first step of the installation should be to print this guide. You will 
find it in the subdirectory "doc" of the main package, under two formats: 
guid1.dvi (DVI format produced by LaTeX) and guid1.ps (PostScript format). You may 
also want to print the other guides but there are not needed for the installation.

  There exists a shell script Install that will try to do the installation for you. 
To run it, just call ./Install from the MegaWave2 root directory. This shell works
for the very common systems and machine architectures only. 


5) SYSTEM REQUIREMENT AND COMPATIBILITY

  MegaWave2 needs a Unix system with the following standard tools :

  [in brackets one gives the group name where the corresponding
   package is usually located on standard Linux distributions. 
   Beware, some of these packages are not selected by default
   during Linux installation stage !]

  C compiler K&R or ANSI-compliant                     [Development/C]
  C language preprocessor cpp;                         [Development/C]
  Lexical analyzer generator lex or flex;              [Development/Other]
  Parser generator yacc or bison;                      [Development/Other]
  Bourne shell script /bin/sh (bash on Linux);         [Shells]
  X11 libraries and include files;                     [System/XFree86]
  bc/dc                                                [Sciences/Mathematics]
  LaTeX (since MegaWave2 Vers 2.10 LaTeX2e is assumed) [Publishing]

  The installation procedure has been successfully checked on the following Unix
systems :

  MegaWave2 Vers 2.20 :
    - Linux :
      + Mandrake 9.0 kernel 2.4.19-16mdk (gcc 3.2, glibc 2.2.5)
      + Mandrake 8.1 kernel 2.4.8-26mdk (gcc 2.96, glibc 2.2.4)
    - SunOS 5.7 (with optional SPROcc package)

  MegaWave2 Vers 2.10 :
 
    - Linux :
      + Mandrake 8.1 kernel 2.4.8-26mdk (gcc 2.96, glibc 2.2.4)
      + RedHat 6.2 kernel 2.2.19ext3 (gcc 2.91, glibc 2.1.3)
      + RedHat 5.2 kernel 2.0.36  (gcc 2.7.2.3, glibc 2.0.7) 
    - HP-UX B.10.20 (with optional HP-UX C compiler)
    - SunOS 5.7 (with optional SPROcc package)

  MegaWave2 Vers 2.00 :

    - Linux RedHat 5.2, Mandrake 6.0
    - HP-UX B.10.20 (with optional HP-UX C compiler)
    - SunOS 5.6, SunOS 5.7 (with optional Solaris C compiler)

  We guess that MegaWave2 V.2.20 may be installed without to much work on the
following Unix systems :

  Linux kernel 2.x with gcc 2.x or gcc 3.y (with y>=2) and glibc 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x
  HP-UX A.09.x
  SGI IRIX 5.x
  SunOS 4.1.x, SunOS 5.x
