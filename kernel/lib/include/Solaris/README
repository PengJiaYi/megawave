		Note for Solaris users

Warning : This include directory in needed by Solaris users only ! 
          If your system is not Solaris, you can remove it.

Strange instructions (which are not, for my point of view,
nor ANSI C nor K&R compliant) in the Solaris include files lead 
the MegaWave2 preprocessor to fail during the C lexical analysis phase.
We had to change some lines and the new include files are located in
this directory. They will be automatically read instead of the standard 
include files.

The problem which occurs on SunOS 5.7 is the following :
Line 21 of stdio_tag.h says
  typedef struct __FILE_TAG __FILE;
and after that, line 38 of stdio_tag.h redefines __FILE_TAG by
  struct __FILE_TAG {...}

This seems not disturb cc, but our lexical analyzer is definitely lost by
this kind of references.
