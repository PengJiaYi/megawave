		Note for Linux users
		--------------------

-------------------------- WARNING --------------------------

1 - This include directory is needed by Linux users only ! 
    If none of your systems is Linux, you may remove it.

2 - The include files listed in this directory have been
    slightly modified from their original distribution :
    they must not been confused with the original ones !

3 - They are useful for the 'traditional' preprocessor only.
    The new 'light' preprocessor does not read system include
    files and is therefore immune from problems explained above.

-------------------------- WARNING --------------------------

Why this directory ?
------------------

Strange instructions (which are not, for our point of view,
nor ANSI C nor K&R compliant, but a super-set of standard instructions
recognized by gcc only) in the Linux gcc include files lead the 
MegaWave2 preprocessor to fail during the C lexical analysis phase,
even if cpp (or gcc -E) is called with the -ansi option. This seems
to be in contradiction with the libc documentation.

We therefore had to change some lines and the new include files are located 
in this directory. They will be automatically read instead of the standard 
include files.

Let us give an example : on Linux 2.0.32 (gcc 2.7), file /usr/include/libio.h, 
line 222, we have the definition
    typedef struct _IO_FILE _IO_FILE;
but the following lines still use "struct _IO_FILE" instead of "_IO_FILE",
as the line 235 :
    _IO_ssize_t (*read) __P ((struct _IO_FILE *, void *, _IO_ssize_t));
This seems not disturb gcc, but our lexical analyzer is definitely lost by
this kind of references.

On Linux 2.2.9 (gcc 2.91 !! Assume gcc 2.8), lot of errors have been removed. 
Still something strange with "__format" on stdio.h (string removed).

If you are a Linux guru, you will probably think there is a better way to
fix the problem, that does not impose to modify the include files !
If this is your case, please fill free to send an email to MegaWave and
explain what we should rather do. Thanks !
