Warning : This include directory in needed by Linux users only ! 
          If your system is not Linux, you can remove it.

Strange instructions (which are not, for my point of view,
nor ANSI C nor K&R compliant) in the Linux gcc include files lead 
the MegaWave2 preprocessor to fail during the C lexical analysis phase.
We had to change some lines and the new include files are located in
this directory. They will be automatically read instead of the standard 
include files.

Let us give an example : on Linux 2.0.32 (gcc 2.7), file /usr/include/libio.h, 
line 222, we have the definition
    typedef struct _IO_FILE _IO_FILE;
but the following lines still use "struct _IO_FILE" instead of "_IO_FILE",
as the line 235 :
    _IO_ssize_t (*read) __P ((struct _IO_FILE *, void *, _IO_ssize_t));
This seems not disturb gcc, but our lexical analyzer is definitely lost by
this kind of references.

On Linux 2.2.9 (gcc 2.91 !! Assume gcc 2.8), lot of errors have been removed. 
Still something strange with "__format" on stdio.h (string removed).

If you are a Linux guru, you will probably think there is a better way to
fix the problem, that does not impose to modify the include files !
If this is your case, please fill free to send an email to MegaWave and
explain what we should rather do. Thanks !
