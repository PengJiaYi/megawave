			----------------------------
			MegaWave2 : Revision History
			----------------------------


Version 2.31	08/10/2004
============

- Minor system revision to offer compatibility with Linux Mandrake 10.0.

Version 2.30	05/05/2004
============

- System library update. 

  + Now, the system uses bibliographical databases where all citations are
    recorded. As this allows cross-references, it is now possible to get all
    modules associated to a given article. 
    See guide #1 "User's Guide" Section "Document a module" to learn more about
    this and to know how to change references in your .tex files.
    Beware: as the code for documentation (.doc file) generated by
    cmw2/cmw2macro commands has changed, you will have to redo
    compilation in your $MY_MEGAWAVE2/src directory in order to get
    documentation macros (such as mwdoc) properly working on private
    modules (anyway, that is always a good idea to redo compilation on private
    modules when the MegaWave2 kernel has changed).

  + It is now possible to generate a html version of the guide #3 "User's Modules 
    and Macros Library" (see system's macro mwmakedoc). In conjunction with 
    bibliographical databases, this allows to read articles associated to a module
    by simply clicking a link (you may also get the html version of the guide #3 from 
    the Megawave homepage).

  + Command 'dc' (an arbitrary precision calculator) has been changed by 'expr' on 
    system's macros to allow installation without the dc/bc package. However, bc or 
    dc may still be needed to run user's macros.

  + System's macros 
    mwecho : new macro for a portable echo with -n and -E options. Replace old
             macro 'mwechon' by 'mwecho -n'.
    mwmakedoc : -h added option to generate html documents (need latex2html).
    mwmodbibtex : add to the bibliography a list of references to modules.
    mwmodsearch : new macro to search for modules and user's macros matching words.
 
  + Conversion from RGB color images to gray scale images has been modified to
    follow the CCIR-601 norm. 

  + Several minor bugs corrected.

- Documentation update.
  + All three guides have been updated.

- Module update.

Version 2.20	15/04/2003
============

- System library update. 

  + The following file (external) types have been added 
        BMP      Microsoft Windows char image format (BitMaP) [1x8-bits plane]
        BMPC     Microsoft Windows color image format (BitMaP) [3x8-bits planes]
        JFIF     JPEG/JFIF char image format from the Independent JPEG Group, 
                 monochrome version [1x8-bits plane] (needs libjpeg).
        JFIFC    JPEG/JFIFC color image format from the Independent JPEG Group
                 [3x8-bits planes] (needs libjpeg).
        PPM      Portable pixmap color image format, rawbits version [3x8-bits planes]
        WAVE_PCM Microsoft's RIFF WAVE sound file format with PCM encoding
    Now, MegaWave2 Ascii files generated under Dos are directly readable.

  + As the new WAVE_PCM file format shows it, support for sound and speech processing
    has been added. This leads to a new field 'bpsample' in the memory (internal) type
    Fsignal, where the number of bit per sample is recorded. In order to be able to play
    a sound after it has been processed by a module, be sure to keep the header unchanged
    (you may use the new function  mw_copy_fsignal_header()).

  + System's macros 
    cmw2 : a warning is issued when a new module has the same name than an
           existing command.
    cmw2_all : option -v added, to get trace of compilations.
    cmw2macro : now link to macros are relative, so you don't need to recompile
                macros when changing name of MegaWave directory.
    mwdoc : in-line documentation of file formats added (mwdoc f).

  + Data files
    Coiflet and Symlet wavelet bases added.
    See also MISCELLANEOUS section below.
 
- Wdevice library update.
  + Driver for wheel button added.

- Documentation update.
  + All three guides have been updated.

- Module update.

Version 2.10	11/02/2002
============


- System library update. 

  + The following memory (internal) types have been added 
	Rawdata : allows to read and write any file format.
  	Dcurve/Dcurves : same as Fcurve/Fcurves but coordinates on double precision.
        Flist/Flists : alternate type for Fcurve/Fcurves, where coordinates
		       are recorded in array (speeds some algoritms).
        Dlist/Dlists : same as Flist/Flists but for coordinates on double precision.
  + Automatic generation of code to convert memory types and file formats,
    see guide #2 "System Library" Section "Conversion between memory types".
  + System options added (see guide #1 "User's Guide" Section "System options"):
    -fsum (function summary), -proto (function prototype), -vers (version number).
  + New system's macros (see guide #1 "User's Guide" Section "System macros"):
	mwrm : safely remove a module or a user's macro.
	mwsysmaclist : list all system's macros.
        mwcmwcheck : check if the MegaWave2 compiler can operate.
  + New optional environmental variable MW_CHECK_HIDDEN, to check at run-time 
    if a module or a macro hides another one.
  + The following system's macros have been renamed :
	make_mw2doc->mwmakedoc, smw2latex->mwdoclatex,  smw2xdvi->mwdocxdvi.
  + Wpanel added (panel display facilities and buttons) : it is a small
    library that allows to handle buttons and bars. It is not documented
    yet, and will probably change quite much in the future. For the time 
    being, it is used only in the module llview.c.
  + Too many bugs fixed to report them !

- Wdevice library update.
 
  + Driver for 16-bits plane added.
  + Keyboard : now handle non-Ascii keys (as control keys). Now WGetKeyboard()
    returns a key code in case of a non-printable character (return type is
    int and no more char). See module llview.c for a demo.

- Documentation update.

  + All three guides have been updated; in particular, morphological structures
    are now documented in the guide #2 "MegaWave2 System Library";
    index has been added in each guide.    
  + Now the three guides are also available in html format
    (see http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/Cmla/Megawave).

- Module update.

  The module library offers several new possibilities:
  + curve evolution (mean curvature motion and affine scale space);
  + image interpolation : bilinear, bicubic, splines;
  + image reduction : splines, prolate;
  + image filters : sharpen, total variation denoising, wiener;
  + new image/detection group (detection of alignments, edges, boundaries);
  + level lines extraction with bilinear interpolation (flst);
  + new or enhanced visualization tools (llview, fkview, splot).

Version 2.00	04/02/2000
============

- No more registration procedure to get a free license : with versions 2.x you 
  do not have any registration form to send.

- Full source code given : The sources of MegaWave2 kernel (preprocessor and 
  libraries) are given. Therefore, you are now able to modify the kernel, for 
  example to adapt it on a new machine architecture.

- No more pre-compiled kernels : the local MegaWave2 administrator has to compile 
  the kernel for its machine architecture by himself.

- MegaWave2 has been adapted for Linux on i386.

- The modules library has deeply changed : new modules appear, former modules have 
  been fully checked and some of them have been renamed. Group hierarchy and name
  has changed. See guide #3 "User's Modules and Macros Library".

- The doc directory structure has changed. Now put the documentation you write in
  the src subdirectory, without creating subdirectories for groups.
  See guide #1 "User's Guide" Section "Documentation".

- The data directory structure has changed, together with the search path convention.
  A PUBLIC subdirectory has been created where all public data not specifically 
  associated to some modules have to be put. To resolve an input filename, a module
  now searches inside all subdirectories of data.
  See guide #2 "System Library" Section "Search path convention".

- System's macros have been enhanced. For example, access to the documentation has
  been simplified (see macro mwdoc).

- System library update.


Version 1.05	07/05/1997
============

- Add binaries and libraries for Silicon Graphics SGI IRIX 5.x.

- System library update: 
	
	New structures have been added, in order to implement morphological 
		data types and associated algorithms. This is a consequence of some
		current research subjects we develop, based on morphological image
		processing. These structures are not currently documented, and the
		morphological modules using them are not currently furnished. This is
		because they are still in development and subject to important changes.
	PGM (portable graymap file format) standard is now recognized to load/save 
		gray levels images, both in the rawbits version (PGMR) and in the 
		Ascii version (PGMA).
	Another alternative is given to access to the pixel of an image, using a 
		bi-dimensional tab (see the guide #1 and the module demo/fadd4).

- Module update:
	In the "common/float_image" group, modules have been put to perform
		some linear filtering operations, as the classical Canny-Deriche's
		edge detector.
	In the "seg" group, modules to perform texture discrimination and 
		segmentation have been added.

- Revision of the guides #1, #2 and #3 to reflect the changes (except for the
	morphological functions, not documented in the guide #2).


Version 1.04	03/06/1996
============

- Solaris users : we apologize that the libraries for Sparc SunOS 5.xx 
	(Solaris) could not be included with this version (just because we 
	do not have anymore access to such a system). On the other hand, we 
	expect to distribute a Silicon Graphics version by the end of 
	summer 96.

- User's macro :
	They are now managed in the same way than modules. It means that
	the location of the user's macro has changed (to be the same
	than modules, into a group) and that each user's macro has to
	be documented.

- System library update: 
	dynamic (shared) library is now given: this save a lot of space
		disk since the system library is no more duplicated into
		each executable module;
	TIFF format may be recognized to load/save images. This assumes you
		have the TIFF library (libtiff);
	change in the file formats of types "MW2_CURVE" and "MW2_CURVES"
		(internal formats "Curve" and "Curves"): Now the (x,y)
		coordinates are recorded using integers (int) instead of
                short integers (short). There is no compatibility between
                the old and new formats;
	change in some system's macros to reflect the way user's macros
		are now managed.

- Module update:
	add group "morpho" where are put the mathematical morphology
		algorithms derived from PDE's methods. 
	add group "shape_recognition" which allows to recognize an image
		among a database of shapes.
	add 2D-FFT and related modules, including "texturization" by
		phase randomization (group common/float_image).

- Revision of the guides #1, #2 and #3 to reflect the changes.

Version 1.03	25/07/1995
============

- System library update: 
	important changes in the Wdevice library, needed by the future
		XMegaWave2 environment; see the new version of the display
		modules (e.g. cview, cmview, splot, ...) and the new display
		demo module called demo/view_demo;
	add the memory types: Fcurve, Fcurves (Float Curves) and
		Fpolygon, FPolygons (Float Polygons);
	new options for cmw2 and cmw2_all, add dependencies list for modules;

- Module update:
	add various basic modules in the common group;
	add the main modules PDE/mam and seg/one_levelset as well as
		various modules in the new group "regular" (pattern 
		recognition by regularity estimation);
	changes in the display modules (needed by the changes in Wdevice):
		cview, ccview, cmview (new name for cmovie), ccmview
		(new name for ccmovie), splot, readpoly;
	
- Revision of the guides #1, #2 and #3 to reflect the changes.


Version 1.02	17/03/1995
============

- Add binaries for Sun sparc SunOS 5.xx (Solaris):
	now the macro "mwarch" has to be called with the option "-s".
- System library update: 
	add the file type "PS" (PostScript) for images;
	add the memory types "ccmovie" and "cfmovie" for color movies;
- Modules update:
	fix slight bugs in PDE/extgc, PDE/amss and in owave;
        add modules for anisotropic diffusion of color images (in PDE);
- Revision of the guides #1, #2 and #3 to reflect the changes.


Version 1.01	23/01/1995
============

Fix bugs in the "owave" group's modules (doc revision will come later).


Version 1.00	20/12/1994
============

Initial release of MegaWave2. The former sofware MegaWave is renamed
MegaWave1 and will not be anymore maintained.
