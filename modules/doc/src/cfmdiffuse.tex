This module applies \verb+N+ times the Total Variation Minimization algorithm 
implemented in \verb+cfdiffuse+ to a color image \verb+in+.
\index{total variation!denoising}
The result is a color movie \verb+out+ built with the successive diffused (smoothed) images of \verb+in+.
Each output image is the smoothed version of the previous image during the time $\delta t$ given by \verb+deltat+.
Such algorithm may be used to restore a noisy image.

To get a description of the used scheme, please see \cite{chambolle.lions:image} and
the documentation of the module \verb+cfdiffuse+.
