This macro processes and puts one or several images of Cimage type
into the SR (Shape Recognition) database, by calling appropriate
modules. 
You call it to build the database (use before \verb+CLEAR_BASE+ to
initialize the data).
After this is done, you can try to recognize images using the
macro \verb+RECOGNIZE+.
