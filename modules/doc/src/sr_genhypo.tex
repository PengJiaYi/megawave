This module produces hypotheses for the affine-invariant shape recognition. 
Given a image {\it img} to recognize and a set of signatures {\it sg}
(computed as a Fimage
using the \verb+SR_Signature+ module), it proceeds this way~:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, it extracts the shape represented by the input image using the 
\verb+extract_connex+ module.
\item Then, it normalizes this shape using \verb+SR_Normalize+.
\item Then, the signature of this normalized shape is computed and compared to
the given signatures {\sf sg}. The 10 best matching signatures are extracted, 
and a list of hypotheses (the corresponding row numbers in the signature 
Fimage {\sf sg})
are printed to the standart output or writen into a one-row Fimage if the
-o option is specified.
\item Last, the normalized shape is returned.
\end{itemize}
