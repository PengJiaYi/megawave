The only purpose of this module is to adapt the matching information
contained in the second output of modules \verb+km_match_ai+
and \verb+km_match_si+, in order to be displayable using the MegaWave2
module \verb+fkview+.  

The most useful outputs of this module are \verb+matching_pieces1+ and
\verb+matching_pieces2+, since these Flists contain the matching pieces
of curve.
