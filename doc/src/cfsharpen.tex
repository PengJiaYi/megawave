This module implements a simple sharpen filter\index{filter!sharpen} 
\index{deblurring}
on color float images.
It works the same way as {\tt fsharpen}, but the filter is applied
on each component of the color image instead of only the gray level 
component. 

If option {\tt -l} is set, the colorimetric model of the input image is 
assumed to be RGB and an internal conversion to the HSV model is performed.
Then, the sharpen is applied on the luminance component and a conversion
back to the RGB model is done.
 
See documentation of {\tt fsharpen} to get the filter used on one component.
