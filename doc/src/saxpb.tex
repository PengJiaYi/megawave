This module performs a so-called ``gain-offset correction'' on the Fsignal
$in$ to obtain a signal $out$ defined by 
$$out(x) = a \cdot in(x) + b.$$
The values of $a$ and $b$ can be set directly or indirectly in terms
of mean and standart deviation of the output signal.

NB: Calling this C-subroutine with $out=in$ is possible
