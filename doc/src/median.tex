This module implements one of the most effective denoising operator of 
mathematical morphology, the median filter. Let $s$ be a shape, i.e. a 
discrete subset of $R^2$, this operator processes an image $u(x)$ into
$$v(x)=\mathrm{med}\left(\,u(x+\delta)\,\right)_{\delta \epsilon s},$$
where the med operator of a sequence $(x_i)_{i=1..n}$ is defined as follows~: 
first sort $(x_i)$ into $(y_i)$ so that $y_1\leq y_2 \leq\ldots\leq y_n$, and 
then define
$$\mathrm{med}\,(x_i)_{i=1..n} = y_{[\frac{n}{2}]}.$$
The iteration of the infinitesimal median filter leads theoritically to mean 
curvature motion, but in practice this process blocks (i.e. the image is
stabilized) after several 
iterations because of the discrete spatial resolution of the image. 
In this module, the 
median operator is iterated $n$ times. If no shape $s$ is specified, a disc
of radius $r$ is taken. A message is printed to the standard output
if the process blocked before the $n$ iterations were achieved.
The complexity of the algorithm is $O(|u| n r^2 \log r)$, so that it costs
less to increase $n$ than $r$.
