This module computes the histogram of a Fimage.
The histogram is given in the Fsignal type.
It counts the number of pixels having a value belonging to a certain
cell (interval) of a uniform grid.
The size and the position of these cells can be specified in different
ways using all combinations of the options. The \verb+-t+ option tells
whether the values outside the specified interval should be ignored or
counted on the boundary cells.
