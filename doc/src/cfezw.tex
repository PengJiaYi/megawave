This module compresses a color floating point image using 
Shapiro's EZW algorithm~\cite{shapiro:embedded} applied to 
its orthogonal/biorthogonal wavelet 
transform\index{wavelet!compression!color images}. 

It simply compresses separately the three channels of color R,G and B.
Therefore, please see the module \verb+fezw+ for details.
