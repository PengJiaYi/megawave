This module splits a curve, given by a 2-Dlist, into convex components.

\medskip

Given 3 successive points $A,B,C$, the determinant
$$d(A,B,C) = (x_B-x_A)(y_C-y_B)-(y_B-y_A)(x_C-x_B)$$ 
is computed, as well as the approximate error
\begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon(A,B,C) = \varepsilon_0 \left( \frac{}{} \right. &\;& 
	|x_B-x_A|*(|y_C|+|y_B|) + (|x_B|+|x_A|)|y_C-y_B| \\
&+&	|y_B-y_A|(|x_C|+|x_B|)  + (|y_B|+|y_A|)|x_C-x_B| 
\qquad \left. \frac{}{} \right),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\varepsilon_0 = 10^{-15}$ is the relative precision of 
\verb+double+ numbers.
The points $B$ for which 
$$|d(A,B,C)|\leq \varepsilon(A,B,C)$$ 
are recursively ignored as ``zero-curvature'' points.

\medskip

For each sequence of 4 successive remaining points $A,B,C,D$,
we say that $(B,C)$ is an inflexion
segment when $d(A,B,C)$ and $d(B,C,D)$ have opposite signs.
When this occurs, we define the middle of $(B,C)$ as an inflexion
point and break the curve accordingly.

The result is a Dlists describing the successive convex components
encountered. Notice that this module is compatible with the convention
that a curve whose first and end points have exactly the same coordinates
must be considered as a closed curve.
