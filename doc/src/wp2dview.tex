This module computes and displays the 2D-wavelet packet transform of an image.
By selecting the option \verb+-p+ one avoids the computation of the
wavelet packet by giving an already computed wavelet packet, as returned
by the module \verb+wp2ddecomp+. In such a case, do not input the
tree / image / impulse response files.


To get details on the implementation of the wavelet packet transform as well
as the various inputs and to have a list of references, see the documentation
of the module \verb+wp2ddecomp+.
