This macro is a demo for matching algorithms based on level lines. 
It extract meaningful level lines (\verb+ll_boundaries+) from two example
images, smooth them (\verb+gass+), build similitude-invariant dictionnaries
(\verb+km_createdict_si+), find matches between the two set of curves
(\verb+km_match_si+) and visualize the results (\verb+km_savematchings+
and \verb+fkview+).
