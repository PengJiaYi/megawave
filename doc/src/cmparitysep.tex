One major default of movie images issued by a video system is the frame 
effect~: because each image is
divided into two mixed frames (even and odd lines) taken at different times, 
any motion on the movie produces an undesired effect of alernated lines.
This module allows to separate even and odd frames on a cmovie. From each image
of the movie, two images are extracted and the missing lines
are interpolated by duplication (default) or linear interpolation (-l flag).
Unless \verb+-e+ flag is specified, the even frame is taken before the odd one.
