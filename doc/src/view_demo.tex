This module shows how to call modules which open a window (here, cview and ccview) from another module (\verb+view_demo+).
Each main function of a module is put into the user's library. 
Make sure to call such function with the right parameters, cview and cciew in 
this example.

When calling several view modules, set the {\em no\_refresh} flag in order to continue 
after the call (this is done by passing a non NULL adress to cview). The flag has
to be unset only for the call to the last view module.

When you want to use the same window for different view modules (as it is the case here
for the first two calls), call each view modules with the adress of the window (instead of a NULL adress). The window has to be opened using the function \verb+mw_get_window()+.
