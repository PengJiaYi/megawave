This modules applies a linear scaling to all components of a Flists.
Each Flist $l=((l_{ij}))$ of $in$ is scaled into
$l'=((s_j\cdot l_{ij}))$, where $(s_j)$ are the coefficients
of the input Fsignal. Hence, the dimension (number of component
per element) of each Flist must be at most the size of $s$.
