This module is required for the 2D Fast Fourier transform ({\sf fft2d}).
It extracts of an input image its largest centered part which dimensions 
are power of $2$.
For example, an original image of size $600 \times 300$ will be shrinked to 
size $512 \times 256$, by extracting the part $[44,555]\times [22,277]$.

NB: Calling this C-subroutine with $out=in$ is nonsense.
