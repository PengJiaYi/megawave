This macro reconstructs a color image from the compressed files 
with prefix {\em compressfile}, 
which have been generated using the wavelet transform + vector quantization 
macro {\em Cfwvq}. It is based on the {\em fwivq} module (applied to 
each channel separately), and is simpler to use. 

It works exactly in the same way that the {\em Fwivq} macro for graylevel 
images, except that there is a possibility to use different codebooks 
for the red, green and blue channels. The codebook arguments should 
be tuned in the same way as during the compression step ({\em Cfwvq}). 

The macro looks for the input compressed files {\em compressfile}r.comp, 
{\em compressfile}g.comp and {\em compressfile}b.comp. 
The reconstructed image is put in {\em compressfile}r.rim. 

All the options should be selected and tuned in exactly the same 
manner at the compression ({\em Cfwvq}) and decompression ({\em Cfwivq}) 
steps.
