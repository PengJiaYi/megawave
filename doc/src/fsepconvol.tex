This modules allows to quickly apply a 2D-convolution to a Fimage in the 
case of a separable kernel,
$$K(x,y)=xker(x)\cdot yker(y).$$
The kernel $K$ can be given with $xker$ and $yker$ (Fsignal), or 
chosen between a constant kernel or a Gaussian kernel, both
with total mass $1$. The boundary assumption is that the initial
image is periodic. See module \verb+fconvol+ for general
convolution with non-separable 2D kernels.
