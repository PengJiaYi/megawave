This module computes the Discrete Fourier Transform of a complex signal using the 
fast algorithm based on the one given in \cite{Press}.
It can also compute the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform, by selecting the appropriate
switch.
Notice that, in this module, complex signals are represented by two fsignals: 
the first one contains the real part of the signal and the second one contains its 
imaginary part.
