This module produces a prolate convolution kernel for optimal
image reduction~\cite{landau.pollak:prolate}. 
Among all $n\times n$ images $u$ such that $u(x)=0$ 
outside a $s\times s$ window and $\int u^2=1$, the energy 
$\int_{|\xi|\leq dn/2} |\hat u(\xi)|^2$ is maximized ($\hat u$ is 
the Fourier Transform of $u$), yielding an optimal image $\bar u$.
The result is then normalized to produce a unit mass kernel 
$out= \bar u/\int \bar u$.
