{\em fthre} copies the input image in the output and makes a thresold 
into the following interval:
\begin{itemize}
\item $]-\infty, \mbox{max}]$ if \verb+-M max+ is selected;
\item $[\mbox{min}, \infty[$ if \verb+-m min+ is selected;
\item $[\mbox{min}, \mbox{max}]$ if both \verb+-m+ and \verb+-M+ are selected.
\end{itemize}

Using the option \verb+-n+ you can normalize the image before the
thresholding. 
In that case, you must select both \verb+-m+ and \verb+-M+ and the
normalization consists to apply an affine transformation on the gray levels,
such that the lowest level becomes the level \verb+min+ and the greatest
level the level \verb+max+.
