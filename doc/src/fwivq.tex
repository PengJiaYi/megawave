This module reconstructs an image from the compressed file Compress, 
which has been generated using the wavelet transform + vector quantization 
module {\em fwvq}\index{quantization!vector}. 
The reconstructed image is put in Result. 

First the wavelet transform of Result is reconstructed, 
using the codebooks CodeBook1, CodeBook2, CodeBook3, ResCodeBook1, 
ResCodeBook2, ResCodeBook3, ResResCodeBook1 and ResResCodeBook2 
(see {\em fwvq} program documentation for information on these codebooks). 
Then a scaling of the coefficients is made if he -w option is selected
Finally an inverse wavelet transform is applied to reconstruct the image
Result. 

All the options should be selected and tuned in exactly the same 
manner at the compression ({\em fwvq}) and decompression ({\em fwivq}) steps. 
Likewise, CodeBook1 and ImpulseResponse should be the same 
at the compression ({\em fwvq}) and decompression ({\em fwivq}) steps. 
Then Result should be identical to the image QImage obtained with {\em fwvq}.
