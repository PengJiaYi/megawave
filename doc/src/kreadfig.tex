This modules converts polygons described by Fig code (read on standart
input) into a Curves structure. This allows, for example, to translate
polygons drawn under xfig v.3.2,
a software available on most Unix and Linux distributions.
For a closed polygon, the convention is that the first and last
point of the corresponding Curve have the same coordinates.
