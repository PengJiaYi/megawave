This module computes $f(r)$, the average value of $|\hat u(\xi)|$ when
$|\xi|=r$. The discretization of the Fsignal $f$ can be set manually
with the \verb+-s+ option.
Note that $\xi$ is normalized in cycles per pixel, so that
$\hat u$ is defined on $[-1/2,1/2]^2$ even for non-square images.
Since $f$ decreases very quickly, it is often better to take
its logarithm (base 10) with the \verb+-l+ option.
