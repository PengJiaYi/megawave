This module implements the heat equation with a finite differences 
scheme using a 4-neighbors estimation of the Laplacian. The 
transform $u\mapsto T(u)$, defined by
$$T(u)(x,y) = 
s \cdot \left( \frac{}{} u(x+1,y)+u(x-1,y)+u(x,y+1)+u(x,y-1) \right)
\; + \; (1-4s) u(x,y),$$
is iterated $n$ times on the image $in$, with the convention
that $u$ is periodic. Notice that the $s$ parameter can be
taken negative for deblurring purposes.
