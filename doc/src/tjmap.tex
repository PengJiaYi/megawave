This module maps in the output cimage $J$ the junctions found in 
the input cimage $U$ : if the point $(x,y)$ is a junction, the
value of $J(x,y)$ will be $255$ and $0$ elsewhere.
The module returns the number of junctions found.
For a description of the Junction Detection Algorithm, please
see~\cite{KP}.

The option \verb+-a+ allows to choose the area threshold associated
to the detection, while the option \verb+-q+ is related to the quantization 
threshold. Those thresholds are used to avoid false detections.
