This module reads 
on standart input a Fcurves structure. The coordinates of the points
must be separated by \verb+<space>+ or \verb+<enter>+. The current curve
is ended with the character 'e' and the whole Fcurves structure ends when
the character 'q' is typed. Example : the command

\verb+echo "10 10 1.3 0 5 2 e 1 1 0.0 -3 q" | fkreadasc c+

puts in $c$ the two curves
$$(10,10)-(1.3,0)-(5,2) \qquad (1,1)-(0,-3).$$
