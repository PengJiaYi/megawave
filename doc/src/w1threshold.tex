This module thresholds a 1D wavelet transform so that a 
wavelet denoising can be performed using the scheme 
wavelet transform $\rightarrow$ thresholding $\rightarrow$ inverse wavelet transform.

In addition, a mask that gives the location of coefficients
that have been thresholded (and the ones that have been kept) can be
generated. Such a mask is needed to perform restoration using TV-minimization
method, see module {\tt stvrestore} and user's macro {\tt Swtvdenoise} for
more about that.
