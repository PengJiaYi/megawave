This module performs a zoom of an image using floating point representation.
The zoom ratio {\em factor} may be a float number.

\medskip

If the \verb+-i+ option is specified, the \verb+funzoom+ module is called
with $tx=ty=0$, the same zoom factor and the corresponding spline order. 
In this case, the \verb+-p+, 
\verb+-x+ and \verb+-y+ options have no effect, and the order is limited
to $\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$.

\medskip

If not, the \verb+fcrop+ module is called 
with the same order options (\verb+-o+, \verb+-p+) 
to produce an image magnified by {\em factor}.


\medskip

Notice that \verb+fzoom -X 0.5+ and \verb+fzoom -i -X 2+ will not have the
same effect: the first one will produce aliasing (at zero order (o=0), 
the first
one is a 2x2 subsampling while the second one is a 2x2 averaging).
