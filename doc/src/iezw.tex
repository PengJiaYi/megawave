This module reconstructs a wavelet transform from its compressed representation 
which is read in {\em Compress}. {\em Compress} must have been generated 
using {\em ezw} or {\em fezw} modules. The resulting wavelet transform is 
put in the files with prefix {\em QWavTrans}. 

{\em Compress} has been obtained by applying the Shapiro's EZW algorithm to 
the wavelet transform of some image. See {\em ezw} module documentation 
for a brief explanation of this algorithm. 

The -w option has the same meaning as in {\em ezw} module and it 
should be tune in the same way. 

The -p option enables to get more information on the decompression process.
