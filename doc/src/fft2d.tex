This module computes the Fast Fourier Transform of a 2D input, given
by two Fimages (real and imaginary parts). It returns two other Fimages,
real and imaginary parts of the Fourier Transform.

Since FFT only applies
to images which dimensions are power of $2$, the input will be shrinked 
to proper dimensions if necessary using the {\sf fshrink2} module. In this
case a warning message will be produced.

The two-dimensional FFT is performed by applying a 1D-FFT on each row
of the 2D input, and then on each column.

Several special cases can occur when you use this module as a 
C subroutine~:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $in\_im=NULL$, the input imaginary part is assumed to be zero 
everywhere.
\item If $out\_re=NULL$ or $out\_im=NULL$, the module assumes that you
don't need the corresponding output.
\end{itemize}
