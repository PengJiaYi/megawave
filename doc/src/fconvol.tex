This module computes the convolution of the Fimage $in$ with the Fimage
$filter$. The result $out$ is defined by
$$out(i,j) = \sum_{k,l} in(i-k,j-l) \cdot filter(k,l).$$
In this sum, it is assumed that functions are zero outside their
domain.
You can use predefined filters put in the \verb+$MEGAWAVE2/data/image+ 
directory (with \verb+.ir+ extension for Impulse Response), 
or you can type your own filter using the module \verb+freadasc+.
\index{filter!convolution}

\smallskip

In the case of a separable filter, that is, a filter than can be
written
$$filter(i,j)=a(i)b(j),$$
it is much faster to use the module \verb+fsepconvol+.
