This module reconstructs an image from the compressed file Compress, 
which has been generated using the vector quantization\index{quantization!vector}
module {\em fvq}. 
The reconstructed image is put in Result. 

Result is reconstructed using the sequences of codebooks contained 
in CodeBook1, CodeBook2, CodeBook3, CodeBook4, ResCodeBook1, 
ResCodeBook2, ResCodeBook3, ResCodeBook4, ResResCodeBook1 and ResResCodeBook2 
(see {\em fvq} module documentation for information on these codebooks). 
The same codebooks should be used during the encoding ({\em fvq}) and 
decoding ({\em fivq}) phases. Then Result should be identical 
to the image QImage obtained with {\em fvq}. 


The -r and -h options enable to specify the number of rows and columns 
in the reconstructed image. They must be activated if the -h option has 
been activated during the encoding process ({\em fvq}) because then this 
information is not included in the header of Compress.
