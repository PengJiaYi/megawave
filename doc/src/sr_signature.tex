This module computes rough rotation-invariant parameters from the input shape,
which allow to compare quickly two normalized shapes.
These parameters measure the density of the shape on increasing rings centered
on its barycenter. They are added as a new row to the Fimage 
{\it base} (if it exists) or returned as a new Fimage.
