This module fills the field \texttt{pixels} of a \texttt{Shapes} structure.
Each shape (as defined in the FLST) points to the array of
pixels belonging to it. Actually, only one array, whose size
is the number of pixels, is allocated and stored in
\verb+pTree->the_shapes[0].pixels+, the other \texttt{pixels} are only
pointers to positions in this array.
The consequence is that in order to free the allocated memory, the user must
use the command 
\verb+free(pTree->the_shapes[0].pixels+.

The number of pixels in each shape is stored in its field \texttt{area}. The
computation of the field \texttt{pixels} allows to quickly examine if the
shape $S$ contains the shape $T$. This condition is simply
\verb+S->pixels <= T->pixels && T->pixels < S->pixels + S->area+, which is
evaluated in constant time.

The complexity of the algorithm is $O(N)$, $N$ being the number of
shapes. This is very fast, which explains why the field \texttt{pixels} needs
not be stored in the file corresponding to a \texttt{Shapes} structure.

This module plays the same role for the bilinear FLST (see module
\texttt{flst\_bilinear}). In this case, the field corresponds to the data
points inside the shapes, i.e., points where the original image values were
given, in contrast to interpolated points.

Notice the field \texttt{pixels} is orthogonal to the term
\texttt{smallest\_shape} of \texttt{Shapes}. The former gives for each shape
the pixels it contains, whereas the latter gives for each pixel the shapes
that contain it. In practice, the computation of \texttt{pixels} relies on the
use of \texttt{smallest\_shape}.
