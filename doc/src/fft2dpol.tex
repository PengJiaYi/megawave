Like the {\sf fft2d} module, this one computes the Fast Fourier Transform 
of a 2D input, given by two Fimages (real and imaginary parts). However,
it returns the Fourier Transform in polar coordinates, meaning the modulus
and the phase (in $[-\pi,\pi]$) as Fimages.

Since FFT only applies
to images which dimensions are power of $2$, the input will be shrinked 
to proper dimensions if necessary using the {\sf fshrink2} module. In this
case a warning message will be produced.

Several special cases can occur when you use this module as a 
C subroutine~:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $in\_im=NULL$, the input imaginary part is assumed to be zero 
everywhere.
\item If $out\_rho=NULL$ or $out\_theta=NULL$, the module assumes that you
don't need the corresponding output.
\end{itemize}
