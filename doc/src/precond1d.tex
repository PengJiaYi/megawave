{\em precond1d} performs the preconditionning (resp. unpreconditionning) 
of the first and last coefficients of a univariate digitized signal, 
before (resp. after) an orthogonal wavelet decomposition or reconstruction 
with adapted filters for edge coefficients. 
If the Daubechies wavelet used for the wavelet transform has cancellation degree $N$, 
then the (un)preconditionning consists in applying an invertible linear transformation 
to the first $N$ and last $N$ coefficients of the signal.

The sample values of the input signal are read in the file {\em Signal}.

The sample values of the output (un)preconditionned signal are stored in the file {\em PrecSignal}.

The coefficients of the preconditionning matrices or filters are read in the file {\em FicEdgeRi}. This file contains also the coefficients of the edge adapted filters for the wavelet decomposition.

The -i option specifies the inverse transformation.
