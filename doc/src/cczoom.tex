This module performs a zoom of an image using color char point representation.
The zoom ratio {\em factor} may be an integer or a float.
In the first case, each pixel of the
original image is duplicated in X and Y direction {\em factor} times.
Note that it's possible to make the duplication only in the X or in the Y
direction.

You can also do unzooming: in this case, each block of $1/\mbox{\em factor} \times 1/\mbox{\em factor}$ pixels are averaging to one pixel (when $1/\mbox{\em factor}$ is an integer; otherwise, no averaging is done).
