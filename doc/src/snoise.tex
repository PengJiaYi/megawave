This module corrupts a Cimage with additive Gaussian noise
or with ``transmission noise''. 

\medskip

With the \verb+-g+ option, a white Gaussian noise with standart deviation $std$
is added to each sample of the signal (see \verb+fnoise+ module for
more details on Gaussian noise).

\medskip

With the \verb+-t+ option, each sample is set to zero with probability
$t/100$.
