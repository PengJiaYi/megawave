This module computes the similitude invariant dictionary of a list of curves. 
This list is typically the result of the module \verb+ll_boundaries+ 
followed by \verb+gass+ (see \verb+KM_DEMO+ for an example), 
which yields the smoothed maximal meaningful 
level lines of an image. For each line in the list, the module 
\verb?km_codecurve_si? computes codes which are added to the dictionary.

\medskip

The result is stored in an Flists structure.
