This module allows to show on the screen an image of fimage type.
It differs from the module \verb+cview+ in the following way.
The intensity associated to a pixel is not equal to the gray level value,
it is proportional only : black corresponds to the minima and white to
the maxima. To get the exact gray level value of one pixel, use the mouse left
button.

Type 'H' in the window to get an one-line help for how to use the mouse.
