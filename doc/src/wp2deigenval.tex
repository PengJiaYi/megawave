This module computes the eigenvalues of an operator which is diagonal
in a 2D-wavelet packet basis. Only the quad-tree is necessary to compute these
eigenvalues, since it defines how the wavelet packet basis splits
the Fourier domain (the quad-tree describes the eigenvectors of the operator).

The output of this module can be used as an input for the option 
\verb+-c+ of the module \verb+wp2doperate+, see the documentation of
these module to get examples.

Operators that are diagonal in wavelet packet bases are useful for
image deconvolution, see \cite{kalifa.mallat.ea:image}, 
\cite{mallat:wavelet} and \cite{malgouyres:framework}.
