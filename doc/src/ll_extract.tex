This module extract level lines from a Fimage.

\begin{itemize}
\item if the \verb+-z+ option is used, the (zero-order) flst is first
computed with area parameter $area$ 
(\verb+flst+ module), and then all level lines are extracted
with the \verb+flst_boundary+ module.
These lines are made of concatenations of segment of length 1. 
As always when using the zero-order flst, be sure that your image is
reasonably quantized before calling this module, since all existing
grey levels are kept in the computation of the flst.
\item if not, then the bilinear flst (\verb+flst_bilinear+ module) is used 
and the resulting tree is quantized on the grid $levels$ or
$offset + n \times step$
with the \verb+flstb_quantize+ module. Then, all level lines corresponding
to these levels are computed and sampled with approximately $prec$ points
per pixel with the \verb+flstb_boundary+ module.
\end{itemize}

The resulting fcurves are stored in a Flists. In both cases, the flst tree
can be precomputed and passed to the program via the \verb+-t+ option.
