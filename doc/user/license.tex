MEGAWAVE2 PUBLIC LICENSE \\
Terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and modification of MegaWave2 version 2.x.
}
\end{center}

You acknowledge to be informed about the following facts, and you accept the consequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item MegaWave2 is a ``soft-publication'' for the scientific community, 
maintained by the image department of the CMLA, URA CNRS 1611 de l'Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure de Cachan.
\item The image department is founded by the CMLA only, using public funds
and private grants for software development.
\item MegaWave2 has been implemented for research purposes only; it comes therefore
without any warranty.
\item The MegaWave2 compiler and the system libraries are known to run on some computer models and operating 
systems only.
\item The CMLA may not maintain this software in the future.
\item The CMLA can not help any user to install nor to use the software.
\item The CMLA may not publish all the code contained in the various versions of MegaWave2.
\item For transparency, the published code contains the source of the mathematical algorithms developed at the 
CMLA.
You are allowed to copy, modify and redistribute these programs.
\end{itemize}

The CMLA claims to impose on the diffusion and on the use of its software the
same rules as the well-known rules which apply to paper publication.

You agree to
\begin{itemize}
\item inform without delay the CMLA (see address next page)
about any contract between yourself or your department and any private or public organization, whenever
its execution uses an algorithm (modified or not) included in MegaWave2.
You will inform this organization about the origin of these algorithms by writing in the contract the use of the 
MegaWave2 software.
\item mention in all products (as computer programs or scientific papers) 
which take advantage of an algorithm included in MegaWave2 (modified or not), the use of this
software together with the name(s) of the author(s) written in the header of 
the corresponding module and with the address of the CMLA and of 
other laboratories implied in the development, if any.
\end{itemize}
