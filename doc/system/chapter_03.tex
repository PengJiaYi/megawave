A movie\index{movie} is a succession of images. In MegaWave2, it is implemented as a
chain of images: you may notice that all types of images have the 
fields \verb+previous+ and \verb+next+(see section~\ref{images}). 
Normally set to \Null, these fields point to the previous image and
to the next image respectively, when the image is part of a movie.
The first image of the movie has a \Null \verb+previous+ field and the
last image of the movie has a \Null \verb+next+ field.

A movie structure is basically a pointer to the first image.
For each image structure corresponds a movie structure.

\label{movies_char-movies}
\def\cmovie{{\tt Cmovie }}
\index{structure!\cmovie}


The {\em Char Movie} memory type corresponds to movies where each images
are of the \cimage memory type. 
The use of this memory type is strongly recommended, since other movies types
waste a lot of memory and computational time.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{The structure Cmovie}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\label{movies_char-movies_structure}

 Beginners should only focus on the field \verb+first+ of this structure:
if \verb+movie+ is of \cmovie type, then \verb+movie->first+ is of \cimage
type and it is the first image of the movie; \verb+movie->first->next+ is
the second image, etc.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct cmovie {
  float scale;     /* Scale (time-domain) of the movie (should be 1) */
  char cmt[mw_cmtsize]; /* Comments */
  char name[mw_namesize]; /* Name of the image */
  Cimage first;    /* Pointer to the first image */
} *Cmovie;
\end{verbatim}
}

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Related file (external) types}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\label{movies_char-file_type}

The way MegaWave2 records movies is the following:
each image is recorded in a separate file, using one of the external types available for the corresponding type Cimage (see section~\ref{images_char-file_type} for more information).
Let suppose that the external name of the movie object is \verb+movie+.
Then, MegaWave2 creates a MegaWave2 Data Ascii file named \verb+movie+ with a \verb+def Cmovie+ area.
In this area is listed the name of the image files, following the order given by the sequence of images.
By changing the order of two file names, you change the order of the images in the sequence (i.e. the name of
the file is not meaningful by itself, for example the image file name \verb+movie_002+ may not be the second
image of the sequence).
There is no limitation for the number of images, up to the available memory.

Note: there is an old format, which is still recognized for backward compatibility. 
Is this old format, the file name \verb+movie+ is empty and the name of each image file is meaningful
(e.g. \verb+movie_002+ is always the second image of the sequence).
In that case, no more than $999$ images per movie can be recorded.

The following is a description of all the functions related to 
the \verb+Cmovie+ type. The list is in alphabetical order.

\section{Color Char movies}
%-----------------------------------------------


\label{movies_color-char-movies}
\def\ccmovie{{\tt Ccmovie }}
\index{structure!\ccmovie}

The {\em Color Char Movie} memory type corresponds to movies where each images
are of the \ccimage memory type. 
Use this memory type each time you have to process color movies.
As in the Char Movies case, the use of this format instead of the corresponding floating point format (\verb+Cfmovie+) is strongly recommended.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{The structure Ccmovie}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\label{movies_color-char-movies_structure}

 Beginners should focus on the field \verb+first+ only of this structure:
if \verb+movie+ is of \ccmovie type, then \verb+movie->first+ is of \ccimage
type and it is the first image of the movie; \verb+movie->first->next+ is
the second image, etc.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct ccmovie {
  float scale;     /* Scale (time-domain) of the movie (should be 1) */
  char cmt[mw_cmtsize]; /* Comments */
  char name[mw_namesize]; /* Name of the image */
  Ccimage first;    /* Pointer to the first image */
} *Ccmovie;
\end{verbatim}

\section{Float movies}

\label{movies_float-movies}
\def\fmovie{{\tt Fmovie }}
\index{structure!\fmovie}

The {\em Float Movie} memory type corresponds to movies where each images
are of the \fimage memory type. 
The use of this memory type is discouraged, since it wastes a lot of memory and computational time.
Use it when you must process data using floating point arithmetic, and when 
you cannot lose precision by converting the output to integer values.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{The structure Fmovie}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\label{movies_float-movies_structure}

 Beginners should focus on the field \verb+first+ only of this structure:
if \verb+movie+ is of \fmovie type, then \verb+movie->first+ is of \fimage
type and it is the first image of the movie; \verb+movie->first->next+ is
the second image, etc.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct fmovie {
  float scale;     /* Scale (time-domain) of the movie (should be 1) */
  char cmt[mw_cmtsize]; /* Comments */
  char name[mw_namesize]; /* Name of the image */
  Fimage first;    /* Pointer to the first image */
