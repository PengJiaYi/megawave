                       COPYRIGHT AND CONTRIBUTIONS

MegaWave2 is a "soft-publication" from the image processing department,
directed by Jean-Michel Morel, part of the following math lab:
CMLA (CNRS UMR-8536), Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, 61 avenue du President 
Wilson, 94235 Cachan cedex, France.

The whole system has been designed and implemented by Jacques Froment, with the 
help of Sylvain Parrino for the preprocessor part. A lot of people made 
contribution to the software by writting modules (see mwcontrib_all to get the 
updated list of all contributors). Since 1998, Lionel Moisan is in charge of 
collecting and improving the module library. Some small parts of the system libraries 
(especially input/output functions related to the X Window System or to image file 
formats) have been written by adapting publicly available source codes. In that case 
the original copyright mentions have been transfered in the corresponding file.

   header of the module or macro.
