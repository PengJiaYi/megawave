                          MEGAWAVE2 PUBLIC LICENSE 

Terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and modification of 
MegaWave2 version 2.x.

You acknowledge to be informed about the following facts, and you accept the 
consequences:
- MegaWave2 is a "soft-publication" for the scientific community, 
  intented to offer reproducible research in image processing.
- MegaWave2 is maintained by the image department of the CMLA, 
  a public french laboratory associated to the CNRS UMR-8536, Ecole Normale 
  Superieure de Cachan.
- The image department is founded by the CMLA only, using public funds and 
  private grants for software development.
- MegaWave2 has been implemented for research purposes only; it comes 
  therefore without any warranty.
- The MegaWave2 compiler and the system libraries are known to run on some 
  computer models and operating systems only.
- The CMLA may not maintain this software in the future.
- The CMLA can not help any user to install nor to use the software.
- The CMLA may not publish all of the code contained in the various versions 
  of MegaWave2.
- For transparency, the published code contains the source of the mathematical
  algorithms developed at the CMLA. You are allowed to copy, modify and 
  redistribute these programs.

The CMLA claims to impose on the diffusion and on the use of its software the
same rules than the well-known rules which apply to paper publication.

You agree to
- inform without delay the CMLA about any contract between yourself or your 
  department and any private or public organization, in the case where its 
  execution uses an algorithm (modified or not) included in MegaWave2. 
  You will inform this organization about the origin of these algorithm by 
  writing in the contract the use of the MegaWave2 software.
- make mention in all products (as computer programs or scientific papers) 
  which take advantage of an algorithm included in MegaWave2 (modified or not),
  of the use of this software together with the name(s) of the author(s) 
  written in the header of the corresponding module and with the address of 
  the CMLA and of other laboratories implied in the development, if any.
