This module transforms an {\tt fmorpho\_line} into 
a {\tt morpho\_line} by a $(+0.5,+0.5)$ translation.
This is consistent with the conventions explained in
{\bf ml\_extract}.

\medskip

If the range of float {\tt fmorpho\_line} points is
$\{x_m,\ldots,x_M\}\times\{y_m,\ldots,y_M\}$, then the 
integer {\tt morpho\_line} points will be in
$\{x_m+0.5,\ldots,x_M+0.5\}\times\{y_m+0.5,\ldots,y_M+0.5\}$.

\medskip

If {\bf fml\_ml} is used in another MW2 module it converts
a list of {\tt fmorpho\_lines} into a list of {\tt morpho\_lines}.
