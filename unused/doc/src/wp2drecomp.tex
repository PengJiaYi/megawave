This module computes the image described by a 2D-wavelet packet
transform. For more details see \cite{mallat:wavelet} and the references
therein.  It is the inverse of the module \verb+wp2ddecomp+. See the
documentation of this module, where details on the
implementation of the wavelet packet transform are provided.
