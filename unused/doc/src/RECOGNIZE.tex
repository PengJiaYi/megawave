This macro tries to recognize the given image (of Cimage type) from
the current SR (Shape Recognition) database.
It should be called after the SR database has been built (see 
\verb+PUT_TO_BASE+).

First, 10 hypotheses are generated by the \verb+sr_genhypo+ module, 
then the corresponding normalized shapes (obtained by the \verb+sr_normalize+
module) are compared according to the \verb+sr_distance+ module, and the 
best hypothesis is given as the result, followed by an error estimation on 
the matching (0\% for a "perfect" matching, 100\% for the worst one).
If the error is over 10\%, consider the shape has not been recognized.
