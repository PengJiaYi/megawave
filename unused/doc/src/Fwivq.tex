This macro reconstructs an image from the compressed file {\em compressfile}, 
which has been generated using the wavelet transform + vector quantization 
module {\em fwvq} (or the {\em Fwvq} macro). It is based on the {\em fwivq} 
module, but is simpler to use. 

One only has to specify the prefix {\em codebook} of all codebook sets 
(see {\em Fwvq} and {\em Fwlbg\_adap} macro documentations for further 
details on the codebook sets managment) and the input compressed file 
(typically a *.comp file generated with {\em Fwvq} macro). 

If the input compressed file has the form *c.comp, then the reconstructed 
image is put in *r.rim. 


All the options should be selected and tuned in exactly the same 
manner at the compression ({\em Fwvq}) and decompression ({\em Fwivq}) steps. 
Likewise, {\em codebook} should be the same 
at the compression ({\em Fwvq}) and decompression ({\em Fwivq}) steps. 
Then *r.rim should be identical to the image *q.rim obtained with {\em Fwvq}.
