This module reconstructs an image from the compressed file Compress, 
which has been generated using the scalar quantization\index{quantization!scalar} 
module {\em fscalq}. 
The reconstructed image is put in Result. Result should be identical 
to the image QImage obtained with {\em fscalq}. 

The -r and -h options enable to specify the number of rows and columns 
in the reconstructed image. They must be activated if the -h option has 
been activated during the encoding process ({\em fscalq}) because then this 
information is not included in the header of Compress.
