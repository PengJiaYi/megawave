This module transforms a {\tt morpho\_line} into 
an {\tt fmorpho\_line} by a $(-0.5,-0.5)$ translation.
This is consistent with the conventions explained in
{\bf ml\_extract}.

\medskip

If the range of integer {\tt morpho\_line} points is
$\{0,\ldots,NC\}\times\{0,\ldots,NL\}$, then the 
float {\tt fmorpho\_line} points will be in
$\{-0.5,\ldots,NC-0.5\}\times\{-0.5,\ldots,NL-0.5\}$.

\medskip

If {\bf ml\_fml} is used in another MW2 module it converts
a list of {\tt morpho\_lines} into a list of {\tt fmorpho\_lines}.
