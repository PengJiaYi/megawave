This module displays on the screen an image of fimage type.
It differs from the module \verb+cview+ because
the displayed intensities are not given by the $fimage$ grey-levels,
but they are renormalized according to the \verb+fthre -N+ module
(the options \verb+-m -M -d -l+ being unchanged).
To get the exact grey-level value of a pixel, use the mouse left
button.
