This module computes the convolution of a \verb+Fsignal+ with a filter;
it is designed for the computation of wavelet packet
transforms. 
\index{convolution}
Therefore, the impulse response of the filter is modified according to the chosen 
options. 

All details concerning these modifications can be
found in \cite{mallat:wavelet} and references therein. 
The names of the functions and the identifiers in the source code of \verb+wpsconvolve+
correspond to those of \cite{mallat:wavelet}. 

The signal is periodized out of its original support, before the
convolution is computed.

The input signal can be of arbitrary size (up to available memory and as long as it 
contains enough samples to compute the convolution).
