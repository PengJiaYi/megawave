This macro compresses a 8 bits graylevel image using EZW 
algorithm~\cite{shapiro:embedded} applied to the orthogonal/biorthogonal 
wavelet coefficients\index{wavelet!compression}. 
It is based on the {\em fezw} module, but is simpler to use. 

One only has to specify the input image name. 
If the -R option is selected, then both a compressed file and a quantized 
image (which can be reconstructed from the compressed file) are generated. 
The compression is made in order to reach the target bit rate {\em Rate}. 
If the input image file has the form *.rim or *.img, then 
the compressed file is named *\_{\em Rate}c.comp and the quantized image file 
is named *\_{\em Rate}q.rim.

If the -R option is not selected, then the rate distortion curve is computed 
(as if the -d option was selected in {\em fezw}). 

Details about wavelet transform are the same as for {\em Fwlbg\_adap} macro. 
The reader is refered to its documentation for information about the -b1, -b2, 
-o and -e options. 


When calling {\em fezw} module, none of the -r, -n, -w, -P and -s option is 
selected.
