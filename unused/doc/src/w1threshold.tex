This module thresholds a 1D wavelet transform so that a 
wavelet denoising\index{denoising!wavelet} can be performed using the scheme 
{\em wavelet transform $\rightarrow$ thresholding $\rightarrow$ inverse wavelet transform}.
See~\cite{donoho.johnstone:ideal} and~\cite{donoho:de-noising} for the theory of 
wavelet thresholding\index{wavelet!thresholding}.

In addition, a mask that gives the location of coefficients
that have been thresholded (and the ones that have been kept) can be
generated. Such a mask is needed to perform restoration using TV-minimization
method, see module {\tt stvrestore} and user's macro {\tt Swtvdenoise} for
more about that.
